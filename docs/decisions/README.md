# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains records of significant architectural decisions made in this project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures a decision along with its context and consequences. They help future developers (including yourself) understand *why* things are the way they are.

## When to Write an ADR

- Choosing between technologies or libraries
- Establishing patterns or conventions
- Making trade-offs that affect the codebase long-term
- Decisions that were hard to make or involved debate

## Template

```markdown
# NNNN. Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [NNNN]

## Context

What is the issue or problem we're addressing?

## Decision

What did we decide to do?

## Consequences
